abstract ={The symmetric island model with D demes and equal migration rates is often chosen for the investigation of the consequences of population subdivision. Here we show that a stepping-stone model has a more pronounced effect on the genealogy of a sample. For samples from a small geographical region commonly used in genetic studies of humans and Drosophila, there is a shift of the frequency spectrum that decreases the number of low-frequency-derived alleles and skews the distribution of statistics of Tajima, Fu and Li, and Fay and Wu. Stepping-stone spatial structure also changes the two-locus sampling distribution and increases both linkage disequilibrium and the probability that two sites are perfectly correlated. This may cause a false prediction of cold spots of recombination and may confuse haplotype tests that compute probabilities on the basis of a homogeneously mixing population.},

abstract = "Abstract We outline two approaches to inference of neighbourhood size, N , and dispersal rate, Ï 2 , based on either allele frequencies or on the lengths of sequence blocks that are shared between genomes. Over intermediate timescales (10â100 generations, say), populations that live in two dimensions approach a quasi-equilibrium that is independent of both their local structure and their deeper history. Over such scales, the standardised covariance of allele frequencies (i.e. pairwise F S T ) falls with the logarithm of distance, and depends only on neighbourhood size, N , and a âlocal scaleâ, Îº ; the rate of gene flow, Ï 2 , cannot be inferred. We show how spatial correlations can be accounted for, assuming a Gaussian distribution of allele frequencies, giving maximum likelihood estimates of N and Îº . Alternatively, inferences can be based on the distribution of the lengths of sequence that are identical between blocks of genomes: long blocks (&gt;0.1Â cM, say) tell us about intermediate timescales, over which we assume a quasi-equilibrium. For large neighbourhood size, the distribution of long blocks is given directly by the classical WrightâMalÃ©cot formula; this relationship can be used to infer both N and Ï 2 . With small neighbourhood size, there is an appreciable chance that recombinant lineages will coalesce back before escaping into the distant past. For this case, we show that if genomes are sampled from some distance apart, then the distribution of lengths of blocks that are identical in state is geometric, with a mean that depends on N and Ï 2 .

  abstract = {We introduce a general recursion for the probability of identity in state of two individuals sampled from a population subject to mutation, migration, and random drift in a two-dimensional continuum. The recursion allows for the interactions induced by density-dependent regulation of the population, which are inevitable in a continuous population. We give explicit series expansions for large neighbourhood size and for low mutation rates respectively and investigate the accuracy of the classical Malcot formula for these general models. When neighbourhood size is small, this formula does not give the identity even over large scales. However, for large neighbourhood size, it is an accurate approximation which summarises the local population structure in terms of three quantities: the effective dispersal rate, ?e; the effective population density, ?e; and a local scale, ?, at which local interactions become significant. The results are illustrated by simulations.

  abstract = {Malecot's models of isolation by distance seem to assume random distribution in space, Poisson distribution of offspring number, and independent migration of individuals. These assumptions are inconsistent. By calculating the probability of joint occupancy of two locations at a distance x, it is shown that a haploid model embodying the latter two assumptions violates the first, forming larger and larger clumps of individuals separated by greater and greater distances. Thus the model is biologically irrelevant, even though it is possible to use it to calculate probabilities of genetic identity at different distances. The formation of these clumps is verified by computer simulation. The same phenomenon occurs in two- and three-dimensional models. In models of finite regions (a circle or a torus), the formation of clumps takes the form of the certainty of ultimate local extinction of the organism in each region. This does not occur if we hold the number of individuals on the circle or torus constant, but considerable departure from random distribution still results. The stepping-stone models appear for the present to be the only well-defined models of geographically structured populations with finite population density.},

The population occupies an unbounded linear habitat; migration is independent of genotype, symmetric, and homogeneous. The treatment is restricted to a single diallelic locus without dominance. With the customary diffusion hypotheses for migration and the assumption that the mutation rates, selection coefficient, variance of the migrational displacement, and reciprocal of the population density are all small and of the same order of magnitude, a boundary value problem is deduced for the mean gene frequency and the covariance between the gene frequencies at any two points in the habitat.},

High relatedness between individuals can arise if they share a small number of recent ancestors, e.g. if they are distant cousins or a larger number of more distant ones, e.g. if their ancestors come from the same region. The most popular methods for investigating these relationships analyse successive markers independently, simply adding the information they provide. This works well for studies involving hundreds of markers scattered around the genome but is less appropriate now that entire genomes can be sequenced. We describe a âchromosome paintingâ approach to characterising shared ancestry that takes into account the fact that DNA is transmitted from generation to generation as a linear molecule in chromosomes. We show that the approach increases resolution relative to previous techniques, allowing differences in ancestry profiles among individuals to be resolved at the finest scales yet. We provide mathematical, statistical, and graphical machinery to exploit this new information and to characterize relationships at continental, regional, local, and family scales.</p>},

abstract ={Population stratification has long been recognized as a confounding factor in genetic association studies. Estimated ancestries, derived from multi-locus genotype data, can be used to perform a statistical correction for population stratification. One popular technique for estimation of ancestry is the model-based approach embodied by the widely applied program structure. Another approach, implemented in the program EIGENSTRAT, relies on Principal Component Analysis rather than model-based estimation and does not directly deliver admixture fractions. EIGENSTRAT has gained in popularity in part owing to its remarkable speed in comparison to structure. We present a new algorithm and a program, ADMIXTURE, for model-based estimation of ancestry in unrelated individuals. ADMIXTURE adopts the likelihood model embedded in structure. However, ADMIXTURE runs considerably faster, solving problems in minutes that take structure hours. In many of our experiments, we have found that ADMIXTURE is almost as fast as EIGENSTRAT. The runtime improvements of ADMIXTURE rely on a fast block relaxation scheme using sequential quadratic programming for block updates, coupled with a novel quasi-Newton acceleration of convergence. Our algorithm also runs faster and with greater accuracy than the implementation of an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm incorporated in the program FRAPPE. Our simulations show that ADMIXTURE's maximum likelihood estimates of the underlying admixture coefficients and ancestral allele frequencies are as accurate as structure's Bayesian estimates. On real-world data sets, ADMIXTURE's estimates are directly comparable to those from structure and EIGENSTRAT. Taken together, our results show that ADMIXTURE's computational speed opens up the possibility of using a much larger set of markers in model-based ancestry estimation and that its estimates are suitable for use in correcting for population stratification in association studies.},

OPTdoi = {10.1534/genetics.110.125534}, 
abstract ={The sequentially Markov coalescent is a simplified genealogical process that aims to capture the essential features of the full coalescent model with recombination, while being scalable in the number of loci.  In this paper, the sequentially Markov framework is applied to the conditional sampling distribution (CSD), which is at the core of many statistical tools for population genetic analyses.  Briefly, the CSD describes the probability that an additionally sampled DNA sequence is of a certain type, given that a collection of sequences has already been observed.   A hidden Markov model (HMM) formulation of the sequentially Markov CSD is developed here, arriving at an algorithm with time complexity linear in both the number of loci and the number of haplotypes.  This work provides a highly accurate, practical approximation to a recently introduced CSD derived from the diffusion process associated with the coalescent with recombination.  It is empirically demonstrated that the improvement in accuracy of the new CSD over previously proposed HMM-based CSDs increases substantially with the number of loci.  The framework presented here can be adopted in a wide range of applications in population genetics, including imputing missing sequence data, estimating recombination rates, and inferring human colonization history.},

abstract = {Resurgence of illicit trade in African elephant ivory is placing the elephant at renewed risk. Regulation of this trade could be vastly improved by the ability to verify the geographic origin of tusks. We address this need by developing a combined genetic and statistical method to determine the origin of poached ivory. Our statistical approach exploits a smoothing method to estimate geographic-specific allele frequencies over the entire African elephants' range for 16 microsatellite loci, using 315 tissue and 84 scat samples from forest (Loxodonta africana cyclotis) and savannah (Loxodonta africana africana) elephants at 28 locations. These geographic-specific allele frequency estimates are used to infer the geographic origin of DNA samples, such as could be obtained from tusks of unknown origin. We demonstrate that our method alleviates several problems associated with standard assignment methods in this context, and the absolute accuracy of our method is high. Continent-wide, 50\% of samples were located within 500 km, and 80\% within 932 km of their actual place of origin. Accuracy varied by region (median accuracies: West Africa, 135 km; Central Savannah, 286 km; Central Forest, 411 km; South, 535 km; and East, 697 km). In some cases, allele frequencies vary considerably over small geographic regions, making much finer discriminations possible and suggesting that resolution could be further improved by collection of samples from locations not represented in our study.},

We present a suite of methods for learning about population mixtures, implemented in a software package called {ADMIXTOOLS}, that support formal tests for whether mixture occurred and make it possible to infer proportions and dates of mixture.

To illustrate the methods, we give a number of examples that provide new insights about the history of human admixture. The most striking finding is a clear signal of admixture into northern Europe, with one ancestral population related to present-day Basques and Sardinians and the other related to present-day populations of northeast Asia and the Americas. This likely reflects a history of admixture between Neolithic migrants and the indigenous Mesolithic population of Europe, consistent with recent analyses of ancient bones from Sweden and the sequencing of the genome of the Tyrolean âIceman.â},

Groups with only {ASI} ancestry may no longer exist in mainland India. However, the indigenous Andaman Islanders are unique in being {ASI}-related groups without {ANI} ancestry. Allele frequency differences between groups in India are larger than in Europe, reflecting strong founder effects whose signatures have been maintained for thousands of years owing to endogamy.

We devise efficient algorithms based on hidden Markov models to localize on a map the recent ancestors (e.g., grandparents) of admixed individuals, joint with assigning ancestry at each locus in the genome. We validate our methods by using empirical data from individuals with mixed European ancestry from the Population Reference Sample study and show that our approach is able to localize their recent ancestors within an average of 470 km of the reported locations of their grandparents. Furthermore, simulations from real Population Reference Sample genotype data show that our method attains high accuracy in localizing recent ancestors of admixed individuals in Europe (an average of 550 km from their true location for localization of two ancestries in Europe, four generations ago). We explore the limits of ancestry localization under our approach and find that performance decreases as the number of distinct ancestries and generations since admixture increases. Finally, we build a map of expected localization accuracy across admixed individuals according to the location of origin within Europe of their ancestors.},

Genetic variation in natural populations typically demonstrates structure arising from diverse processes including geographical isolation, founder events, migration, and admixture. One technique commonly used to uncover such structure is principal components analysis, which identifies the primary axes of variation in data and projects the samples onto these axes in a graphically appealing and intuitive manner. However, as the method is non-parametric, it can be hard to relate {PCA} to underlying process. Here, I show that the underlying genealogical history of the samples can be related directly to the {PC} projection. The result is useful because it is straightforward to predict the effects of different demographic processes on the sample genealogy. However, the result also reveals the limitations of {PCA}, in that multiple processes can give the same projections, it is strongly influenced by uneven sampling, and it discards important information in the spatial structure of genetic variation along chromosomes.},

<p>The demographic history of our species is reflected in patterns of genetic variation within and among populations. We developed an efficient method for calculating the expected distribution of genetic variation, given a demographic model including such events as population size changes, population splits and joins, and migration. We applied our approach to publicly available human sequencing data, searching for models that best reproduce the observed patterns. Our joint analysis of data from African, European, and Asian populations yielded new dates for when these populations diverged. In particular, we found that African and Eurasian populations diverged around 100,000 years ago. This is earlier than other genetic studies suggest, because our model includes the effects of migration, which we found to be important for reproducing observed patterns of variation in the data. We also analyzed data from European, Asian, and Mexican populations to model the peopling of the Americas. Here, we find no evidence for recurrent migration after East Asian and Native American populations diverged. Our methods are not limited to studying humans, and we hope that future sequencing projects will offer more insights into the history of both our own species and others.</p>

A barrier to dispersal or a local region of low abundance has a similar effect (Nagylaki, 1976). The cline will block the flow of neutral alleles over a region of chromosome roughly 2 sqrt s/t map units long.

IBS tracts shared between DNA sequences from different populations also contain information about population divergence and past gene flow. By looking at IBS tracts shared within Africans and Europeans, as well as between the two groups, we infer that the two groups diverged in a complex way over more than 40,000 years, exchanging DNA as recently as 12,000 years ago. Besides having anthropological importance, the history we infer predicts the distribution of pairwise differences between humans extremely accurately at a fine-scale level, which may aid future scans for natural selection in the genome. Despite our current focus on human data, the method is general enough to use on other organisms and has the potential to shed light on the demography of many more species.</p>},

However, determining which habitats should be set aside to promote connectivity has been difficult because existing models cannot incorporate effects of multiple pathways linking populations. Here, we test an ecological connectivity model that overcomes this obstacle by borrowing from electrical circuit theory. The model vastly improves gene flow predictions because it simultaneously integrates all possible pathways connecting populations. When applied to data from threatened mammal and tree species, the model consistently outperformed conventional gene flow models, revealing that barriers were less important in structuring populations than previously thought. Circuit theory now provides the best-justified method to bridge landscape and genetic data, and holds much promise in ecology, evolution, and conservation planning.},

Based on these results, I propose a method of data analysis involving the regression of FST/ (1 Ð FST) estimates for pairs of subpopulations on geographic distance for populations along linear habitats or logarithm of distance for populations in two-dimensional habitats. This regression provides in principle an estimate of the product of population density and second moment of parental axial distance.

In a population with restricted dispersal, analytic theory shows that there is a simple relationship between M and geographic distance in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium populations and that this relationship is approximately independent of mutation rate when the mutation rate is small.

It predicts rates of loss of neutral genetic variation, fixation of deleterious and favourable alleles, and the increase of inbreeding experienced by a population. A method exists for the estimation of Ne from the observed linkage disequilibrium between unlinked loci in a population sample. While an increasing number of studies have applied this method in natural and managed populations, its reliability has not yet been evaluated. We developed a computer program to calculate this estimator of Ne using the most widely used linkage disequilibrium algorithm and used simulations to show that this estimator is strongly biased when the sample size is small (<{\texttenthousand}100) and below the true Ne. This is probably due to the linkage disequilibrium generated by the sampling process itself and the inadequate correction for this phenomenon in the method. Results suggest that Ne estimates derived using this method should be regarded with caution in many cases. To improve the method's reliability and usefulness we propose a way to determine whether a given sample size exceeds the population Ne and can therefore be used for the computation of an unbiased estimate.",

 abstract = {The gene arrangement in the third chromosome of Drosophila pseudoobscura is variable. Each gene arrangement occurs in populations of a definite geographic area. However, two or more gene arrangements may occur together in many populations. Inversion homozygotes and heterozygotes occur frequently in natural populations. The relative frequencies of various gene arrangements in some populations undergo seasonal cyclic changes. These changes are produced by natural selection, and represent adaptive reconstructions of the population genotype, thus facilitating survival in different seasonal environments. Some of the changes taking place in nature can be reproduced experimentally in 'population cages' (figure 3). Populations containing desired proportions of chromosomes with different gene arrangements are introduced into the cages, samples of the eggs deposited by the flies in the cages are taken from time to time, and the incidence of the chromosomes of different types determined in these samples. Most experiments have been made with chromosomes derived from parents collected at Pinon Flats, Mount San Jacinto, California, and some from Mather, California. The relative proportions of chromosomes with different gene arrangements remain constant in population cages kept at 161/2⚬ C. Changes are frequently observed in cages kept at temperatures above 20⚬ C.: the incidence of some gene arrangements increases and of others decreases. However, the final outcome of the selective process is rarely a complete replacement of one gene arrangement by another. Instead, an equilibrium is usually reached at which all gene arrangements present in the initial population of an experimental cage are retained, but often with frequencies very different from the initial ones. The establishment of equilibria in the populations indicates that individuals heterozygous for different gene arrangements (inversion heterozygotes) are characterized by the highest adaptive values, while homozygotes are relatively inferior in survival and reproduction. The correctness of this interpretation is demonstrated by means of observations on deviations from the Hardy-Weinberg proportions of heterozygotes and homozygotes among the adult flies developed in the population cages (see page 10). The balanced polymorphism, resulting from the superiority of the heterozygotes over the corresponding homozygotes, permits the species to react adaptively to changes in its environment. The species is 'buffered' against environmental change; at the same time, the adaptive responses do not consume or deplete the store of hereditary variability present in the species.},

	abstract = {A classic problem in population genetics is the characterization of discrete population structure in the presence of continuous patterns of genetic differentiation. Especially when sampling is discontinuous, the use of clustering or assignment methods may incorrectly ascribe differentiation due to continuous processes (e.g., geographic isolation by distance) to discrete processes, such as geographic, ecological, or reproductive barriers between populations. This reflects a shortcoming of current methods for inferring and visualizing population structure when applied to genetic data deriving from geographically distributed populations. Here, we present a statistical framework for the simultaneous inference of continuous and discrete patterns of population structure. The method estimates ancestry proportions for each sample from a set of two-dimensional population layers, and, within each layer, estimates a rate at which relatedness decays with distance. This thereby explicitly addresses the {\textquotedblleft}clines versus clusters{\textquotedblright} problem in modeling population genetic variation, and remedies some of the overfitting to which nonspatial models are prone. The method produces useful descriptions of structure in genetic relatedness in situations where separated, geographically distributed populations interact, as after a range expansion or secondary contact. We demonstrate the utility of this approach using simulations and by applying it to empirical datasets of poplars and black bears in North America.},

In a heterogeneous habitat, this may occur more quickly in some regions than in others: for example, barriers to gene flow can accelerate differentiation between neighboring groups. We use the concept of 'effective migration' to model the relationship between genetics and geography. In this paradigm, effective migration is low in regions where genetic similarity decays quickly. We present a method to visualize variation in effective migration across a habitat from geographically indexed genetic data. Our approach uses a population genetic model to relate effective migration rates to expected genetic dissimilarities. We illustrate its potential and limitations using simulations and data from elephant, human and Arabidopsis thaliana populations. The resulting visualizations highlight important spatial features of population structure that are difficult to discern using existing methods for summarizing genetic variation.},

Dispersal is particularly important in creating genetic structure on the landscape. We often observe a pattern of decreased genetic relatedness between individuals as geographic distances increases, or isolation-by-distance. This pattern is particularly pronounced in organisms with extremely short dispersal distances. Despite the ubiquity of isolation-by-distance patterns in nature, there are few examples that explicitly demonstrate how limited dispersal influences spatial genetic structure. Here we investigate the processes that result in spatial genetic structure using the Florida Scrub-Jay, a bird with extremely limited dispersal behavior and extensive genome-wide data. We take advantage of the long-term monitoring of a contiguous population of Florida Scrub-Jays, which has resulted in a detailed pedigree and measurements of dispersal for hundreds of individuals. We show how limited dispersal results in close genealogical relatives living closer together geographically, which generates a strong pattern of isolation-by-distance at an extremely small spatial scale (<10 km) in just a few generations. Given the detailed dispersal, pedigree, and genomic data, we can achieve a fairly complete understanding of how dispersal shapes patterns of genetic diversity over short spatial scales.},

abstract = {Classical models of gene flow fail in three ways: they cannot explain large-scale patterns; they predict much more genetic diversity than is observed; and they assume that loosely linked genetic loci evolve independently. We propose a new model that deals with these problems. Extinction events kill some fraction of individuals in a region. These are replaced by offspring from a small number of parents, drawn from the preexisting population. This model of evolution forwards in time corresponds to a backwards model, in which ancestral lineages jump to a new location if they are hit by an event, and may coalesce with other lineages that are hit by the same event. We derive an expression for the identity in allelic state, and show that, over scales much larger than the largest event, this converges to the classical value derived by Wright and Malécot. However, rare events that cover large areas cause low genetic diversity, large-scale patterns, and correlations in ancestry between unlinked loci.}

Here we present the implications of these results for the conservation and landscape genomics of the desert tortoise. Our work strongly indicates that several well-defined genetic groups exist within the species, including a primary north-south genetic discontinuity at the Ivanpah Valley and another separating western from eastern Mojave samples. We also use existing desert tortoise habitat modeling data with a novel extension of genetic "resistance distance" using geographic maps of continuous space to predict the relative impacts of five proposed development alternatives within the DRECP and rank them with respect to their likely impacts on desert tortoise gene flow and connectivity in the Mojave. Finally, we analyzed the impacts of each of the 214 distinct proposed development area "chunks", derived from the proposed development polygons, and ranked each chunk in terms of its range-wide impacts on desert tortoise gene flow.},

These identity-by-descent (IBD) blocks are direct traces of recent coalescence events and, as such, contain ample signal to infer recent demography. Here, we examine sharing of such blocks in two-dimensional populations with local migration. Using a diffusion approximation to trace genetic ancestry, we derive analytical formulas for patterns of isolation by distance of IBD blocks, which can also incorporate recent population density changes. We introduce an inference scheme that uses a composite-likelihood approach to fit these formulas. We then extensively evaluate our theory and inference method on a range of scenarios using simulated data. We first validate the diffusion approximation by showing that the theoretical results closely match the simulated block-sharing patterns. We then demonstrate that our inference scheme can accurately and robustly infer dispersal rate and effective density, as well as bounds on recent dynamics of population density. To demonstrate an application, we use our estimation scheme to explore the fit of a diffusion model to Eastern European samples in the Population Reference Sample data set. We show that ancestry diffusing with a rate of [Formula: see text] during the last centuries, combined with accelerating population growth, can explain the observed exponential decay of block sharing with increasing pairwise sample distance.},

Here, we introduce an inference scheme that uses this signal to detect and estimate the strength of a linear barrier to gene flow in two dimensions. We use a diffusion approximation to model the effects of a barrier on the geographic spread of ancestry backward in time. This approach allows us to calculate the chance of recent coalescence and probability of identity by descent. We introduce an inference scheme that fits these theoretical results to the geographic covariance structure of bialleleic genetic markers.

We investigate the power of our inference scheme to detect barriers by applying it to a wide range of simulated data.

We review the effects of such structuring on neutral variants, using a framework based on the coalescent process. Short-term effects of sex differences and age structure can be averaged out using fast timescale approximations, allowing a simple general treatment of effective population size and migration. We consider the effects of geographic structure on variation within and between local populations, first in general terms, and then for specific migration models. We discuss the close parallels between geographic structure and stable types of genetic structure caused by selection, including balancing selection and background selection. The effects of departures from stability, such as selective sweeps and population bottlenecks, are also described. Methods for distinguishing population history from the effects of ongoing gene flow are discussed. We relate the theoretical results to observed patterns of variation in natural populations. }

Finally we outline some directions for future research.}

abstract = {The difficulty of directly measuring gene flow has lead to the common use of indirect measures extrapolated from genetic frequency data. These measures are variants of FST, a standardized measure of the genetic variance among populations, and are used to solve for Nm, the number of migrants successfully entering a population per generation. Unfortunately, the mathematical model underlying this translation makes many biologically unrealistic assumptions; real populations are very likely to violate these assumptions, such that there is often limited quantitative information to be gained about dispersal from using gene frequency data. While studies of genetic structure per se are often worthwhile, and FST is an excellent measure of the extent of this population structure, it is rare that FST can be translated into an accurate estimate of Nm.}

  abstract = {Abstract Dispersal is a central process in ecology and evolution. At the individual level, the three stages of the dispersal process (i.e., emigration, transience and immigration) are affected by complex interactions between phenotypes and environmental factors. Condition- and context-dependent dispersal have far-reaching consequences, both for the demography and the genetic structuring of natural populations and for adaptive processes. From an applied point of view, dispersal also deeply affects the spatial dynamics of populations and their ability to respond to land-use changes, habitat degradation and climate change. For these reasons, dispersal has received considerable attention from ecologists and evolutionary biologists. Demographic and genetic methods allow quantifying non-effective (i.e., followed or not by a successful reproduction) and effective (i.e., with a successful reproduction) dispersal and to investigate how individual and environmental factors affect the different stages of the dispersal process. Over the past decade, demographic and genetic methods designed to quantify dispersal have rapidly evolved but interactions between researchers from the two fields are limited. We here review recent developments in both demographic and genetic methods to study dispersal in wild animal populations. We present their strengths and limits, as well as their applicability depending on study objectives and population characteristics. We propose a unified framework allowing researchers to combine methods and select the more suitable tools to address a broad range of important topics about the ecology and evolution of dispersal and its consequences on animal population dynamics and genetics.},

IBE represents one of the most important patterns that results from the ways in which landscape heterogeneity influences gene flow and population connectivity, but it has only recently been examined in studies of ecological and landscape genetics. Nevertheless, the study of IBE presents valuable opportunities to investigate how spatial heterogeneity in ecological processes, agents of selection and environmental variables contributes to genetic divergence in nature. New and increasingly sophisticated studies of IBE in natural systems are poised to make significant contributions to our understanding of the role of ecology in genetic divergence and of modes of differentiation both within and between species. Here, we describe the underlying ecological processes that can generate patterns of IBE, examine its implications for a wide variety of disciplines and outline several areas of future research that can answer pressing questions about the ecological basis of genetic diversity.},

For DNA sequence data, the same formula can be used if FST is replaced by NST. In a population with restricted dispersal, analytic theory shows that there is a simple relationship between M and geographic distance in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium populations and that this relationship is approximately independent of mutation rate when the mutation rate is small. Simulation results show that with reasonable sample sizes, isolation by distance can indeed be detected and that, at least in some cases, non-equilibrium patterns can be distinguished. This approach to analyzing isolation by distance is used for two allozyme data sets, one from gulls and one from pocket gophers.},

F0 is the probability that two alleles drawn from the same group are identical in state and F is the probability for two alleles drawn at random from the entire population. These probabilities can be assessed from molecular polymorphisms. GST has a number of properties that make it useful for empirical studies. When the mutation rate is small relative to the migration rate and the reciprocal of the group size, GST depends mainly on the absolute number of migrants per generation, moves rapidly to near equilibrium, and is independent of the number of alleles. The relative homogenizing effect of migration in the island and stepping-stone models is not as different as might be expected; one immigrant chosen randomly from the rest of the population is only one to two times as effective as one from a neighboring group, appreciably exceeding 2 only when there are 1000 or more groups. The use of molecular data to estimate the degree of population subdivision may permit testable predictions of the extent of altruistic behavior.},

abstract = {Contrary to assumptions commonly made in the study of population genetics, the demographic properties of many populations are not always constant. Important characteristics of populations such as migration rate and population size may vary in time and space. Moreover, local populations often come and go; the rate of extinction and the properties of colonization may also vary. In this paper, the approach to equilibrium following a disturbance in the genetic variance among populations is described. The rate of migration is shown to be critical in determining the extent to which extinction and recolonization affects genetic differentiation. Perturbations and variations through time and space in demographic parameters such as population size and migration rate are shown to be important in determining the partitioning of genetic variance. Equations are given to predict the average through time of genetic differentiation among populations in the event of a single disturbance or in constant fluctuations in the pertinent demographic parameters. In general, these fluctuations increase the FST of a species. Spatial demographic variation affects FSTmuch more than temporal variation. These demographic properties make some species unsuitable for the empirical analysis of migration with indirect genetic measures. Demographic instability may play a large role in the evolution of genetic variation.},

@article{haller2018treesequence,
  abstract = {There is an increasing demand for evolutionary models to incorporate relatively realistic dynamics, ranging from selection at many genomic sites to complex demography, population structure, and ecological interactions. Such models can generally be implemented as individual-based forward simulations, but the large computational overhead of these models often makes simulation of whole chromosome sequences in large populations infeasible. This situation presents an important obstacle to the field that requires conceptual advances to overcome. The recently developed tree-sequence recording method (Kelleher et al., 2018), which stores the genealogical history of all genomes in the simulated population, could provide such an advance. This method has several benefits: (1) it allows neutral mutations to be omitted entirely from forward-time simulations and added later, thereby dramatically improving computational efficiency; (2) it allows neutral burn-in to be constructed extremely efficiently after the fact, using "recapitation"; (3) it allows direct examination and analysis of the genealogical trees along the genome; and (4) it provides a compact representation of a population{\textquoteright}s genealogy that can be analyzed in Python using the msprime package. We have implemented the tree-sequence recording method in SLiM 3 (a free, open-source evolutionary simulation software package) and extended it to allow the recording of non-neutral mutations, greatly broadening the utility of this method. To demonstrate the versatility and performance of this approach, we showcase several practical applications that would have been beyond the reach of previously existing methods, opening up new horizons for the modeling and exploration of evolutionary processes.},

  abstract = {With the desire to model population genetic processes under increasingly realistic scenarios, forward genetic simulations have become a critical part of the toolbox of modern evolutionary biology. The SLiM forward genetic simulation framework is one of the most powerful and widely used tools in this area. However, its foundation in the Wright-Fisher model has been found to pose an obstacle to implementing many types of models; it is difficult to adapt the Wright-Fisher model, with its many assumptions, to modeling ecologically realistic scenarios such as explicit space, overlapping generations, individual variation in reproduction, density-dependent population regulation, individual variation in dispersal or migration, local extinction and recolonization, mating between subpopulations, age structure, fitness-based survival and hard selection, emergent sex ratios, and so forth. In response to this need, we here introduce SLiM 3, which contains two key advancements aimed at abolishing these limitations. First, the new non-Wright-Fisher or "nonWF" model type provides a much more flexible foundation that allows the easy implementation of all of the above scenarios and many more. Second, SLiM 3 adds support for continuous space, including spatial interactions and spatial maps of environmental variables. We provide a conceptual overview of these new features, and present several example models to illustrate their use. These two key features allow SLiM 3 models to go beyond the Wright-Fisher model, opening up new horizons for forward genetic modeling.},

@article{kelleher2018efficient,
  abstract = {In this paper we describe how to efficiently record the entire genetic history of a population in forwards-time, individual-based population genetics simulations with arbitrary breeding models, population structure and demography. This approach dramatically reduces the computational burden of tracking individual genomes by allowing us to simulate only those loci that may affect reproduction (those having non-neutral variants). The genetic history of the population is recorded as a succinct tree sequence as introduced in the software package msprime, on which neutral mutations can be quickly placed afterwards. Recording the results of each breeding event requires storage that grows linearly with time, but there is a great deal of redundancy in this information. We solve this storage problem by providing an algorithm to quickly {\textquoteright}simplify{\textquoteright} a tree sequence by removing this irrelevant history for a given set of genomes. By periodically simplifying the history with respect to the extant population, we show that the total storage space required is modest and overall large efficiency gains can be made over classical forward-time simulations. We implement a general-purpose framework for recording and simplifying genealogical data, which can be used to make simulations of any population model more efficient. We modify two popular forwards-time simulation frameworks to use this new approach and observe efficiency gains in large, whole-genome simulations of one to two orders of magnitude. In addition to speed, our method for recording pedigrees has several advantages: (1) All marginal genealogies of the simulated individuals are recorded, rather than just genotypes. (2) A population of N individuals with M polymorphic sites can be stored in O(N log N + M) space, making it feasible to store a simulation{\textquoteright}s entire final generation as well as its history. (3) A simulation can easily be initialized with a more efficient coalescent simulation of deep history. The software for recording and processing tree sequences is named tskit.},

@article{wilkins2004separationoftimescales,
  abstract = {This article presents an analysis of a model of isolation by distance in a continuous, two-dimensional habitat. An approximate expression is derived for the distribution of coalescence times for a pair of sequences sampled from specific locations in a rectangular habitat. Results are qualitatively similar to previous analyses of isolation by distance, but account explicitly for the location of samples relative to the habitat boundaries. A separation-of-timescales approach takes advantage of the fact that the sampling locations affect only the recent coalescent behavior. When the population size is larger than the number of generations required for a lineage to cross the habitat range, the long-term genealogical process is reasonably well described by Kingman's coalescent with time rescaled by the effective population size. This long-term effective population size is affected by the local dispersal behavior as well as the geometry of the habitat. When the population size is smaller than the time required to cross the habitat, deep branches in the genealogy are longer than would be expected under the standard neutral coalescent, similar to the pattern expected for a panmictic population whose population size was larger in the past.

When this occurs, reproductive surpluses from productive source habitats may maintain populations in sink habitats, where local reproductive success fails to keep pace with local mortality. For animals with active habitat selection, an equilibrium with both source and sink habitats occupied can be both ecologically and evolutionarily stable. If the surplus population of the source is large and the per capita deficit in the sink is small, only a small fraction of the total population will occur in areas where local reproduction is sufficient to compensate for local mortality. In this sense, the realized niche may be larger than the fundamental niche. Consequently, the particular species assemblage occupying any local study site may consist of a mixture of source and sink populations and may be as much or more influenced by the type and proximity of other habitats as by the resources and other conditions at the site.},

To understand the interplay between temporal correlations, spatial heterogeneity and dispersal on persistence, an analytic approximation for this growth rate is derived for partially mixing populations. Partial mixing has two effects on population growth. In the absence of temporal correlations in relative fitness, greater movement to patches with, on average, higher relative fitness increases population growth rates. In the absence of spatial heterogeneity in the average relative fitnesses, lower dispersal rates enhance population growth when temporal autocorrelations of relative fitness within a patch exceed temporal cross-correlations in relative fitness between patches. This approximation implies that metapopulations whose expected fitness in every patch is less than 1 can persist if there are positive temporal autocorrelations in relative fitness, sufficiently weak spatial correlations and the population disperses at intermediate rates. It also implies that movement into lower quality habitats increases the population growth rate whenever the net temporal variation in per capita growth rates is sufficiently larger than the difference in the means of these per capita growth rates. Moreover, temporal autocorrelations, whether they be negative or positive, can enhance population growth for optimal dispersal strategies.}

abstract = {Abstract Natural history museum collections provide unique resources for understanding how species respond to environmental change, including the abrupt, anthropogenic climate change of the past century. Ideally, researchers would conduct genome-scale screening of museum specimens to explore the evolutionary consequences of environmental changes, but to date such analyses have been severely limited by the numerous challenges of working with the highly degraded DNA typical of historic samples. Here, we circumvent these challenges by using custom, multiplexed, exon capture to enrich and sequence ~11 000 exons (~4 Mb) from early 20th-century museum skins. We used this approach to test for changes in genomic diversity accompanying a climate-related range retraction in the alpine chipmunks (Tamias alpinus) in the high Sierra Nevada area of California, USA. We developed robust bioinformatic pipelines that rigorously detect and filter out base misincorporations in DNA derived from skins, most of which likely resulted from postmortem damage. Furthermore, to accommodate genotyping uncertainties associated with low-medium coverage data, we applied a recently developed probabilistic method to call single-nucleotide polymorphisms and estimate allele frequencies and the joint site frequency spectrum. Our results show increased genetic subdivision following range retraction, but no change in overall genetic diversity at either nonsynonymous or synonymous sites. This case study showcases the advantages of integrating emerging genomic and statistical tools in museum collection-based population genomic applications. Such technical advances greatly enhance the value of museum collections, even where a pre-existing reference is lacking and points to a broad range of potential applications in evolutionary and conservation biology.},

By explicitly modeling population history and genetic drift as a time-series, Dystruct more accurately and realistically discovers shared ancestry from ancient and contemporary samples. Formally, we use a normal approximation of drift, which allows a novel, efficient algorithm for optimizing model parameters using stochastic variational inference. We show that Dystruct outperforms the state of the art when individuals are sampled over time, as is common in ancient DNA datasets. We further demonstrate the utility of our method on a dataset of 92 ancient samples alongside 1941 modern ones genotyped at 222755 loci.

abstract = "Genetic information contains a record of the history of our species, and technological advances have transformed our ability to access this record. Many studies have used genome-wide data from populations today to learn about the peopling of the globe and subsequent adaptation to local conditions. Implicit in this research is the assumption that the geographic locations of people today are informative about the geographic locations of their ancestors in the distant past. However, it is now clear that long-range migration, admixture, and population replacement subsequent to the initial out-of-Africa expansion have altered the genetic structure of most of the world's human populations. In light of this we argue that it is time to critically reevaluate current models of the peopling of the globe, as well as the importance of natural selection in determining the geographic distribution of phenotypes. We specifically highlight the transformative potential of ancient DNA. By accessing the genetic make-up of populations living at archaeologically known times and places, ancient DNA makes it possible to directly track migrations and responses to natural selection."

We used this to produce an atlas of worldwide human admixture history, constructed by using genetic data alone and encompassing over 100 events occurring over the past 4000 years. We identified events whose dates and participants suggest they describe genetic impacts of the Mongol empire, Arab slave trade, Bantu expansion, first millennium CE migrations in Eastern Europe, and European colonialism, as well as unrecorded events, revealing admixture to be an almost universal force shaping human populations.},

Our approach builds upon the previously developed EEMS method, which infers effective migration rates under a dense lattice. Similarly, we infer demographic parameters under a lattice and use a (Voronoi) prior to regularize parameters of the model. However, our method differs from EEMS in a few key respects. First, we use the coalescent model parameterized by migration rates and population sizes while EEMS uses a resistance model. As another key difference, our method uses haplotype data while EEMS uses the average genetic distance. A consequence of using haplotype data is that our method can separately estimate migration rates and population sizes, which in essence is done by using a recombination rate map to calibrate the decay of haplotypes over time. An additional useful feature of haplotype data is that, by varying the lengths analyzed, we can infer demography associated with different recent time periods. We call our method MAPS for estimating Migration And Population-size Surfaces. To illustrate MAPS on real data, we analyze a genome-wide SNP dataset on 2224 individuals of European ancestry.},

    abstract = {Author Summary The unusual and complex correlation structure of population samples of genetic sequences presents a fundamental statistical challenge that pervades nearly all areas of population genetics. Historical recombination events produce an intricate network of intertwined genealogies, which impedes demography inference, the detection of natural selection, association mapping, and other applications. It is possible to capture these complex relationships using a representation called the ancestral recombination graph (ARG), which provides a complete description of coalescence and recombination events in the history of the sample. However, previous methods for ARG inference have not been adequately fast and accurate for practical use with large-scale genomic sequence data. In this article, we introduce a new algorithm for ARG inference that has vastly improved scaling properties. Our algorithm is implemented in a computer program called ARGweaver, which is fast enough to be applied to sequences megabases in length. With the aid of a large computer cluster, ARGweaver can be used to sample full ARGs for entire mammalian genome sequences. We show that ARGweaver performs well in simulation experiments and demonstrate that it can be used to provide new insights about both demographic processes and natural selection when applied to real human genome sequence data.},

abstract = "Assessing the impacts of ongoing climate and anthropogenic-induced change on wildlife populations requires understanding species distributions and abundances across large spatial and temporal scales. For threatened or declining populations, collecting sufficient broad-scale data is challenging as sample sizes tend to be low because many such species are rare and/or elusive. As a result, demographic data are often piecemeal, leading to difficulties in determining causes of population changes and developing strategies to mitigate the effects of environmental stressors. Thus, the population dynamics of threatened species across spatio-temporal extents is typically inferred through incomplete, independent, local-scale studies. Emerging integrative modeling approaches, such as integrated population models (IPMs), combine multiple data types into a single analysis and provide a foundation for overcoming problems of sparse or fragmentary data. In this paper, we demonstrate how IPMs can be successfully implemented by synthesizing the elements, advantages, and novel insights of this modeling approach. We highlight the latest developments in IPMs that are explicitly relevant to the ecology and conservation of threatened species, including capabilities to quantify the spatial scale of management, source-sink dynamics, synchrony within metapopulations, and population density effects on demographic rates. Adoption of IPMs has led to improved detection of population declines, adaptation of targeted monitoring schemes, and refined management strategies. Continued methodological advancements of IPMs, such as incorporation of a wider set of data types (e.g., citizen science data) and coupled population-environment models, will allow for broader applicability within ecological and conservation sciences."

Dispersal and competition regimes influence the extent to which various scales or frequencies of spatial variation in carrying capacity can be represented in the spatial pattern of abundance. Specifically, increasing the size d an individual's resource-capture zone (e.g., territory or root area) increases the representation in the pattern of abundance of fine scales or high-frequency components of the carrying capacity variation. In contrast, increasing average dispersal, distance decreases representation of the high-frequency components in the spatial pattern of the carrying capacity.

abstract = {Abstract The spread of parasites is inherently a spatial process often embedded in physically complex landscapes. It is therefore not surprising that infectious disease researchers are increasingly taking a landscape genetics perspective to elucidate mechanisms underlying basic ecological processes driving infectious disease dynamics and to understand the linkage between spatially dependent population processes and the geographic distribution of genetic variation within both hosts and parasites. The increasing availability of genetic information on hosts and parasites when coupled to their ecological interactions can lead to insights for predicting patterns of disease emergence, spread and control. Here, we review research progress in this area based on four different motivations for the application of landscape genetics approaches: (i) assessing the spatial organization of genetic variation in parasites as a function of environmental variability, (ii) using host population genetic structure as a means to parameterize ecological dynamics that indirectly influence parasite populations, for example, gene flow and movement pathways across heterogeneous landscapes and the concurrent transport of infectious agents, (iii) elucidating the temporal and spatial scales of disease processes and (iv) reconstructing and understanding infectious disease invasion. Throughout this review, we emphasize that landscape genetic principles are relevant to infection dynamics across a range of scales from within host dynamics to global geographic patterns and that they can also be applied to unconventional ‘landscapes’ such as heterogeneous contact networks underlying the spread of human and livestock diseases. We conclude by discussing some general considerations and problems for inferring epidemiological processes from genetic data and try to identify possible future directions and applications for this rapidly expanding field.},

These observed changes are heavily biased in the directions predicted from global warming and have been linked to local or regional climate change through correlations between climate and biological variation, field and laboratory experiments, and physiological research. Range-restricted species, particularly polar and mountaintop species, show severe range contractions and have been the first groups in which entire species have gone extinct due to recent climate change. Tropical coral reefs and amphibians have been most negatively affected. Predator-prey and plant-insect interactions have been disrupted when interacting species have responded differently to warming. Evolutionary adaptations to warmer conditions have occurred in the interiors of species' ranges, and resource use and dispersal have evolved rapidly at expanding range margins. Observed genetic shifts modulate local effects of climate change, but there is little evidence that they will mitigate negative effects at the species level. }

With biparental reproduction, each individual leaves a {\textquotedblleft}pedigree{\textquotedblright} of descendants, determined by the biparental relationships in the population. The pedigree of an individual constrains the lines of descent of each of its genes. An individual{\textquoteright}s reproductive value is the expected number of copies of each of its genes that is passed on to distant generations conditional on its pedigree. For the simplest model of biparental reproduction (analogous to the Wright{\textendash}Fisher model), an individual{\textquoteright}s reproductive value is determined within \~{}10 generations, independent of population size. Partial selfing and subdivision do not greatly slow this convergence. Our central result is that the probability that a gene will survive is proportional to the reproductive value of the individual that carries it and that, conditional on survival, after a few tens of generations, the distribution of the number of surviving copies is the same for all individuals, whatever their reproductive value. These results can be generalized to the joint distribution of surviving blocks of the ancestral genome. Selection on unlinked loci in the genetic background may greatly increase the variance in reproductive value, but the above results nevertheless still hold. The almost linear relationship between survival probability and reproductive value also holds for weakly favored alleles. Thus, the influence of the complex pedigree of descendants on an individual{\textquoteright}s genetic contribution to the population can be summarized through a single number: its reproductive value.},
